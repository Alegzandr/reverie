 * Mood switch = plunging into a new environment. The cockpit glass stays put
 * (the compositor); the world we're leaving dissolves as we break through it,
 * while the new environment rises out of a slight zoom and settles into focus
 * around us - a centred luminous swell (in the new mood's own colour) cresting
 * over the cockpit at the threshold. Spectacular but composed: no lateral slide,
 * no sci-fi chrome, one slow expo curve. All GPU-composited (transform / opacity
 * / filter) and gated by `animatedBackdropAllowed()`, so under
 * `prefers-reduced-motion` (or on touch) nothing here runs and the calm 300ms
 * body cross-fade stands in.
