## What you can do

### Reshape the sound
- **Speed Up** — high-energy sped-up versions (1.1x to 2.0x).
- **Slow + Reverb** — atmospheric, slowed-down remixes with adjustable reverb.
- **8D Audio** — immersive spatial sound that rotates around your headphones, with adjustable speed.
- **Bass Boost** — deeper low end in three strengths (Light, Normal, Strong).

Everything is **live**: press play, move any control, and the sound changes instantly. There is no "Apply" or "Process" step, you just listen and tune until it feels right.

### Listen to everything
- **Playlists that remember**: drop files or whole folders; Reverie keeps them on your device (nothing is uploaded) and brings the list, the track and the position back next time. Clear it in one click.
- **Made for long sessions**: next/previous, shuffle, repeat the playlist or one track, drag to reorder, filter long lists, keyboard and media keys.

### Make it yours
- **🪐 Moods** — eight living worlds rendered in real time and listening to the music: Nebula Drift, Borealis, Moon Tide, Echo Valley, Sakura Dusk, City Pop, Singularity and Daybreak. Switch in one tap from the top bar; your choice is remembered.
- **💓 Breathe with the music** — the world, the glass and the play button react to what's playing. When you stop touching anything, the interface fades away and leaves you with the world.
- **📊 See your track** — a live waveform doubles as the seek bar and previews the effect you're applying, alongside a compact spectrum meter.
- **🌍 Ten languages** — English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi.
- **♿ Accessible** — full keyboard navigation, screen-reader support, and a calm static fallback if you prefer reduced motion.

### Keep your quality (and your privacy)
- **Smart export** — Reverie saves in the format you loaded whenever possible: MP3→MP3, WAV→WAV, AIFF→AIFF, FLAC→FLAC, WebM→WebM, OGG→OGG, M4A→M4A.
- **100% private** — all processing happens in your browser. Nothing is uploaded, tracked, or stored on a server.
- **Install it** — add Reverie to your desktop as an app (PWA) and it works offline.

## How to use it

1. **Load your music** — drag and drop files or folders, or click to browse. Supports MP3, WAV, AIFF, FLAC, OGG/Opus, WebM, AAC/M4A, and more.
2. **Pick an effect** — Speed Up, Slow + Reverb, 8D Audio, or Bass Boost.
3. **Press play and tune** — every slider reshapes the sound in real time.
4. **Set a mood** (optional) — pick a world from the switcher in the top bar.
5. **Export** — download your remix, matched to the original format and quality.

## For developers

Reverie is a 100% client-side app built with **React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS v4**. All audio runs on the **Web Audio API**, with lazy-loaded encoders (lamejs for MP3, libFLAC WASM for FLAC, MediaRecorder for WebM/OGG/M4A).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # dev server at http://localhost:5173
npm run build          # tsc -b && vite build → dist/
npm run lint           # eslint
npx vitest run         # test suite (single pass)
```

Requires Node.js 20+.

### Architecture in brief

Two audio engines that must stay sonically identical:

- **`src/utils/effectGraph.ts`** — the persistent live Web Audio graph. Effect changes ramp nodes in real time (~40 ms), no bake step.
- **`src/utils/audioProcessor.ts`** — the offline render (`OfflineAudioContext`) used only at export time.

Exports are dispatched per source format via a Strategy pattern (`src/utils/exportStrategies.ts`), with fallbacks (FLAC→WAV, MediaRecorder→MP3). Moods live in `src/contexts/moods.ts` and their WebGL2 worlds in `src/components/scenes/world/`; the playlist persists through IndexedDB (`src/utils/playlistStore.ts`); every UI string goes through i18next across all 10 locales in `src/i18n/locales/`.

Deeper docs: [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) (architecture + rules), [`PRODUCT.md`](PRODUCT.md) (product vision), [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) (visual system).

### Contributing

Fork, branch, and open a PR. Keep tests colocated (`*.test.tsx?`) and passing, run `npm run lint`, and use conventional commit messages. Deployment to GitHub Pages is automated via GitHub Actions on every push to `main` (lint → typecheck → test → build → deploy).
